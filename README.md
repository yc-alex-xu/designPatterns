## Argument about design patterns
Since it was proposed by GoF, there are many argument. 
I think:
* design pattern mainly focused how to handle the change, the common solution adding a middle layer, so it will bring the flexibiltity, and will bring cost & complexity too. So no need to use the design pattern just for it.
* design pattern need support from language, e.g. here it need template of C++; vice versa, many modern language enforce some design pattern internally. Java that implements the design pattern already â€” such as closing windows in Swing or registering listeners with event-causing objects.

* it is not holy grail, just kind of abstract, can help understanding the code between different SW designer. and a kind of design referenc. it shall make SW designer work easier, not more difficlut.

## SOLID 
is an acronym which stands for the following design principles (and their abbreviations):
* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
* Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## 23 of those standard patterns

## Code
* c++14 standard
* tested under WSL/gcc version 7.4.0 (Ubuntu 18.04.1)
